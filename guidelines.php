                <h2>Guidelines</h2>
                <p>You can enter in any of the following categories:</p>
                <p><strong>City Landscape:</strong> The city in question should be Aberdeen!</p>
                <p><strong>Conceptual and Expressive:</strong> Your picture does not have to be of landscape, nature or green space. The word "Blooming” is sometimes used to comment on something cheekily or mischievously. In this category you can express yourself freely as young adults living in Aberdeen. To help us understand we will need you to give the picture a title and/or tell us the reason that you took this picture.</p>
                <p><strong>Nature in Bloom:</strong> You can express this title freely in whichever season you enter the competition as long as it is a picture of nature in Aberdeen. (It doesn’t literally have to be “blooming”)</p>
                <p><strong>Street Photography:</strong> The street(s) should be in Aberdeen.</p>
                <p><strong>Portrait on Location:</strong> The location should be in Aberdeen! The portrait may be of anyone who has given their permission.</p>
                <p><strong>The competition is free to enter.</strong></p>
                <p>You must be currently living in Aberdeen to enter the competition. You must be between your 16th and 25th birthdays to enter the competition. You can enter the competition at any time between October 2015 and 31st July 2016</p>
                <p><strong>How to enter:</strong></p>
                <p>You can enter the competition on a camera phone or any other equipment. You can send in the photograph by signing up <a href="signup.php">here</a></p>
                <p>Photographs will be judged according to a range of criteria. Technical skills are no more important than expression. The Judges include a professional photographer, a marketing company, environmental managers, local voluntary organisations and business volunteers.</p>
